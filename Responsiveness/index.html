					<h1>Allow me to Introduce Myself</h1>
                    <p> Hello, I'm Anthony. I am currently a Software Engineering student attending Thinkful and living in Phoenix, Arizona!</p>
                    <p> I have a had a growing interest over the past couple of years in learning how sites are made and what makes 
                        softwares "tick" if you will, so I've finally made the leap to begin the program and start the journey!
                    </p>
                    <p> I've always been an individual who seeks out a variety of learning opportunities and building skills.
                        The Thinkful program is a journey that I've been wanting to challenge myself with for a while, so this is my newest endeavour.
                        On the side, I enjoy investing in the Stock Market as well as Real Estate which leads to exciting adventures day in and day out.
                    </p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item item-double">
          <p>I'm from Glenville, West Virginia which is a tiny tiny town. Somehow, we had a state college there which is where
              I graduated from with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. I quickly realized I should have specialized with a Degree
              in Technology, so after researching programs, I chose Thinkful. I now have a passion to gain an understanding and knowledge
              of how technology <i> actually</i> works, and this program has already taught me more than I could have imagined!
          </p>

          <p>I want to provide services for new businesses centered around making beautiful and responsive websites that are functional across
              multiple platforms, so they can have a storefront that showcases their qualities.
